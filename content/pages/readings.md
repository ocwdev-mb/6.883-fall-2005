6.883 is a graduate paper-reading seminar. As such, each class session begins with a brief presentation followed by a discussion of the assigned reading material, which is listed below. To help in preparing for the discussion, each student is asked to write a one-paragraph commentary on the assigned reading the day before the class meets to discuss it.
